### Welcome to the Project - The Bot is on Fire ###

The project has been made by:
Atharv Karbhari - NetId (amk546)
Jayanth Kumar - NetId (jj1112)

The folder structure is mainly run by three files:

1. main.py
We can either generate simulations, plot simulation results or run the UI game here.
Simply use the main.py.example file into main.py to use

2. win.py
This file is used to generate or plot data related to bot performance / winnability. Use win.py.example
to unpack the contents

3. constants.py
This file contains various constants such as ALPHA, FLAMMABILITY, time pause between two time steps.
Unpack constants.py.example into constants.py
